# Yokai-No-Mori

Android implementation of the board game Yokai No Mori. Yōkai no mori is a shogi-based board game created in 2008. Shogi is a traditional Japanese game, approaching chess and opposing two players.

This android implementation is only in **French**. The two versions of the game are implemented: *classic* (3x4), *expert* (5x6). The rules of the game are explained [Here](http://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/92ca7d_5856df1dca8e4bedaebb3ed89b7f0855.pdf).

>Inspired by the Shogi – traditional Japonese game – Yōkaï no mori is a very simple game, but with a great tactical and strategic scope. One of its particularities is that the pieces are never definitively eliminated: its new owner can thus put any piece captured back in the game at any moment.
